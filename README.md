# Data Analysis on Asteroids

In this project i will be performing data analysis on the NASA JPL Asteroid dataset to see what conclusions we can extrapolate from it, 
with regard to the potential danger that asteroid pose to humanity.

The dataset was provided by the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory of California Institute of Technology](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb_query.cgi) and it includes many asteroids 
and their physical parameters as they relate to orbital mechanics. 

The focus of this project was to determine what makes an asteroid potentially dangerous to human life on Earth.

In order to view the project simply open the jupyter notebook zerotopandas-course-project.ipynb, everything else is explained within it.

Following tasks completed in the project:
   - data preparation and cleaning
   - exploratory analysis and visualization
   - asking and answering questions related to the observed data

This project represents the capstone project for the online course on data analysis provided by Jovian.ml.
Special thanks to [Aakash N S](https://medium.com/@aakashns) and the rest of the Jovian.ml crew that made the course possible.
