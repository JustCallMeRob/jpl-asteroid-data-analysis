# Data Analysis on Asteroids

In this project i performed data analysis on the NASA JPL Asteroid dataset to see what conclusions I can extrapolate from it with regard to the potential danger that asteroids pose to humanity.

The dataset was provided by the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory of California Institute of Technology](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb_query.cgi) and it includes many asteroids 
and their physical parameters as they relate to orbital mechanics. 

The focus of this project was to determine what makes an asteroid potentially dangerous to human life on Earth.

In order to view the project simply open the jupyter notebook zerotopandas-course-project.ipynb, everything else is explained within it.

This project represents the capstone project for the online course on [Data Analysis with Python](https://jovian.ai/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas) provided by Jovian.ml.
Special thanks to [Aakash N S](https://medium.com/@aakashns) and the rest of the Jovian.ml crew that made the course possible.
